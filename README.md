# autosaxs
Two classes for doing automated analysis of SAXS data.

runner.py illustrates how one might create a control file to direct the analysis module to files, set q^2 limits for guinier analysis, etc.

.inspect_data() allows the user to quickly view and compare large numbers of SAXS patterns

.batch_process() will perform a user-defined set of analysis procedures and produce .csv and .xlsx files with the corresponding data for plotting
